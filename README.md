# Rainbow Code Generator

Quick project I made because I couldn't find a random generator for [rainbow codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rainbow_Codes)

[Rainbow Code Generator](https://jhr007.github.io/rainbow-code-generator/)

Look for the list of colors/codes in `/app/routes/index.js`
